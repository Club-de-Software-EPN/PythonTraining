One Hundred Years of Solitude
Gabriel Garcia Marquez
Many years later, facing the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to
remember that remote afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. Macondo was then
a village of twenty mud and reed houses built on the banks of a river with diaphanous waters
tumbling down a bed of polished stones, white and huge as eggs
prehistoric. The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and to
to mention them you had to point the finger. Every year, for the month of March, a family
of ragged gypsies pitched their tent near the village, and with a great uproar of whistles and
kettledrums unveiled new inventions. They brought the imam first.
